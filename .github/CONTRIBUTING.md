   - Instead, follow the responsible disclosure guidelines in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

2. **Bug Reports**  
   - If you encounter a bug, check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/martakisalex/shared-workflows-test/issues) to see if it has already been reported.  
   - If not, open a **new issue** and provide detailed reproduction steps.

3. **Feature Requests**  
   - Have an idea for a new feature or an improvement?  
   - Open an **issue** and describe your proposal.

4. **Pull Requests**  
   - Fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request.
   - Ensure your changes follow the **branch naming conventions** and **commit guidelines** outlined below.

## **Reporting Issues**

Before opening an issue:

- **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicates.
- **Provide clear details**, including:
  - Steps to reproduce the problem.
  - Expected behavior vs. actual behavior.
  - Relevant logs or screenshots (if applicable).

If reporting a **security issue**, please follow the steps outlined in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

## **Submitting Pull Requests**

Follow these steps to submit a **PR**:

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   - Click the "Fork" button on GitHub.

2. **Create a New Branch**  
   - Use a descriptive branch name following our [Branch Naming Conventions](#branch-naming-conventions):

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make and Commit Your Changes**  
   - Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) when writing commit messages:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add sample workflow for testing manual triggers"
   ```

4. **Push Your Branch to GitHub**
  
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Open a Pull Request**  
   - Go to the **Pull Requests** tab in GitHub.
   - Select your branch and open a new PR.
   - Ensure your PR title follows the format **`<type>: <short description>`** (see [Commit Types](#commit-types)).

## **Branch Naming Conventions**

To maintain a clean Git history, use the following branch naming format:

```git
<type>/<short-description>
```

- `<type>`: Must be one of `feat`, `fix`, `hotfix`, `chore`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`, `perf`, `build`.
- `<short-description>`: A concise, hyphen-separated description of the change.

### **Rules**

- Use **lowercase** letters.
- Separate words in `<short-description>` with **hyphens**.
- Keep descriptions **concise but meaningful**.
- PR titles **must match the branch type** for consistency.
